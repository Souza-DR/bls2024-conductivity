# bls2024-conductivity
In this work  we consider two types of inverse conductivity problems: electrical impedance tomography (EIT) which involves boundary measurements, and an inverse conductivity problem with internal measurements.

To run the tests, select the parameters in the `parameters.py` file, save it, and execute the command `python3 main.py` in the root directory.
