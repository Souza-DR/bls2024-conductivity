<!-- # bls2024-conductivity
## Introduction
In this work  we consider two types of inverse conductivity problems: electrical impedance tomography (EIT) which involves boundary measurements, and an inverse conductivity problem with internal measurements.

## To run the codes
### Pre requisite
- Install [Fortran](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/)
- Install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Install [gfort2py](https://github.com/rjfarmer/gfort2py)
- Install [Fenics](https://fenicsproject.org/download/archive/)

### Parameters
To run the tests, select the parameters in the `parameters.py` file, save it, and execute the command `python3 main.py` in the root directory. -->
